Created by Nick Turner (@nickjvturner@mastodon.social)

Download image files in bulk from Airtable.

The idea here, is that you created an Airtable base, each record has
at a minimum, a name field and an image attachment field, with a single image.

This script takes the 'export' from Airtable as '.csv' and pulls down the attached
image from the Airtable servers during the ~3 hour availability window, post
export.

This script can handle multiple images per record.
