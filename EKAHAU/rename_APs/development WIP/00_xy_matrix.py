Created with [SIMULATED APs] as the targets...

WIP - Work in Progress, not tested / not necessarily ready to be used

long description
---
per floor
script places all APs into a list
the list is sorted by:
    x-axis value, y-axis value
    specifically in this order
the sorted list is iterated through and a new AP Name is assigned
AP numbering starts at 1, with:
    apSeqNum = 1
    this is an integer
AP Naming pattern is defined by:
    new_AP_name = f'AP-{apSeqNum:03}'
    this is an f-string
    {apSeqNum:03} is a formatted expression that represents the variable apSeqNum with specific formatting
    :03 specifies the formatting of this integer should be with leading zeros to have a width of 3 characters
    If apSeqNum is less than 100, it will be padded with leading zeros to ensure the resulting string has a total of 5 characters

This script does not really do anything that simply sorting by x-axis value would achieve, it is only included here
as the basic code starting block for the fuzzy grouping renaming scripts.
